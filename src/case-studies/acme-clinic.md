### Challenge
Tampa Family Medicine struggled with 18 % no‑show rates and staff spending hours each day on phone reminders.

### Solution
We deployed a HIPAA‑ready WhatsApp chatbot that:
* Confirms appointments automatically 24/7
* Sends adaptive reminders (48 h & 3 h before)
* Offers embedded reschedule links that sync to DrChrono

### Outcome
Within six weeks the clinic saw a 35 % reduction in missed appointments and freed two FTE hours daily.
